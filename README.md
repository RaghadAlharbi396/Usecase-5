## Job Postings Dataset in Saudi Arabia
In an ever-evolving job market, understanding the dynamics of employment opportunities is crucial. This dataset provides comprehensive insights into job postings in Saudi Arabia, sourced from Jadarat. It contains valuable information, including company details, job descriptions, required qualifications, job tasks, salaries, contract specifics, and more.
Our primary goal is to analyze the employment landscape within the Kingdom. We aim to explore several key questions:
What proportion of job postings is attributed to each region within Saudi Arabia?
Is there a gender preference indicated in the job postings?
What is the expected salary range for fresh graduates?
Are job opportunities predominantly targeted at individuals with experience, or is there room for fresh graduates as well?

By delving into this dataset, we hope to uncover trends and patterns that will provide a clearer picture of the job market, helping job seekers, employers, and policymakers make informed decisions.

This exploration not only seeks to highlight the opportunities available but also to understand the underlying factors shaping employment in Saudi Arabia today.
